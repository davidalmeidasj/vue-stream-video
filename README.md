This template should help get you started developing with Vue 3 in Vite.

## Type Support for `.vue` Imports in TS

TypeScript cannot handle type information for `.vue` imports by default, so we replace the `tsc` CLI with `vue-tsc` for type checking. In editors, we need [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) to make the TypeScript language service aware of `.vue` types.

## Project Setup

```sh
copy .env.example to .env
```


```sh
set url videos:
VITE_YOUTUBE_URL=''
VITE_VIMEO_URL=''
```

```sh
yarn
```

### Compile and Hot-Reload for Development

```sh
yarn dev
```

### Type-Check, Compile and Minify for Production

```sh
yarn build
```

### Run Unit Tests with [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/)

```sh
yarn test:unit
```

### Run End-to-End Tests with [Playwright](https://playwright.dev)

```sh
# Install browsers for the first run
npx playwright install
npx playwright install-deps

Alternatively, use apt: sudo apt-get install libgstreamer-plugins-bad1.0-0\libavif16

# When testing on CI, must build the project first
yarn build

# Runs the end-to-end tests
yarn test:e2e
# Runs the tests only on Chromium
yarn test:e2e --project=chromium
# Runs the tests of a specific file
yarn test:e2e tests/example.spec.ts
# Runs the tests in debug mode
yarn test:e2e --debug
```

### Lint with [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)

```sh
yarn lint
